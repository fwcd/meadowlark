/// This struct should contain all state that the UI will bind to. This should
/// mirror the `ProjectSaveState` plus whatever extra state is needed for the UI.
///
/// (Yes we are duplicating state from `ProjectSaveState`). This is for a couple
/// of reasons:
///
/// 1. This separates areas of concerns, so the UI can be developed independently
/// of the backend.
/// 2. Even if a project is not loaded in the backend, the UI should still show
/// something in its place like empty tracks and mixers.
/// 3. This makes it clearer what state the GUI cares about by consolidating all
/// state into the `ui_state` folder (as apposed to state being scattered around
/// the backend and various other 3rd party crates).
/// 4. This will make it easier to create "bindings/lenses" for data-driven UI
/// paridigms.
/// 5. This `UiState` struct is only exposed to the UI as an immutable reference
/// via the `StateSystem` struct. This ensures that any mutation of state *must*
/// go through the `StateSystem` struct which is responsible for keeping
/// everything in sync.
/// 6. Memory is cheap nowadays anyway, and it's not like we're cloning large
/// blocks of data like audio samples (the largest things we will clone will
/// mostly just be strings, piano roll clips, and automation tracks).
